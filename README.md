# Lox interpreters

Workspace for going through Robert Nystrom's [Crafting
Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com). Rather than reading this repo,
you probably want to go to his site and read the book directly from there.

The original code for _Crafting Interpreters_ is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters).
